<p>Welcome to ThingsBase. As far as we know this is the first
hackerspace inventory management application. Hackerspace members
often have limited resources (like space) but an abundance of
hardware. To keep our space from becoming a complete tech graveyard,
we decided to whip up and inventory application. We're working on it,
so bear with us (or jump in!) 

<p>The source can be found on github
at <a href="http://github.com/HackRVA/hackrva-inventory-application">
http://github.com/HackRVA/hackrva-inventory-application</a>.  If you have any
Django experience (or not, I'm learning as I go, which might be a little
obvious), don't be afraid to grab the source and get involved!

<p>Happy Hacking!
